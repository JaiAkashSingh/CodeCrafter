# Javascript
There are several different ways to define variables, the most common of which today is let. We start by giving it a name, which will normally be in camelcase, then assign a value to it. It's a dynamically typed language, which means no data type annotations are necessary. In this case, we've assigned a number, which is one of the seven primitive data types built into the language. However, we don't need to assign the variable a value right now because it can be reassigned later. Without an assignment, it automatically uses the primitive value of undefined as its default value. However, we can explicitly represent an empty value using null, and later on, we could reassign that same variable to a string. It's an entirely different data type, but that's perfectly okay.<br />

Now, any value that's not a primitive will inherit from the object class, but more on that later. Right now, we need to talk about the semicolon. Technically, semicolons are optional because if you leave them out, the JavaScript parser will add them automatically. In real life, JavaScript developers will often fight to the death over whether or not to use semicolons.
But let is not the only way to define a variable. Another common option is const, which is used for variables that cannot be reassigned later. But the original way to declare a variable is VAR. I would recommend ignoring its existence altogether, although you will find it out in the wild.
The reason we have so many different ways to define variables has to do with the lexical environment, which determines where variables work and where they don't. There's a global scope, which is where we are right now, which means this variable will be available everywhere. However, if we define a variable inside a function, it then becomes local
Let's start with data types. JavaScript has several primitive data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, and symbols. It also has a non-primitive data type called objects. Variables in JavaScript are dynamically typed, which means you don't have to declare the type of a variable before using it. Instead, the type of a variable is inferred based on the value assigned to it.
When it comes to scoping, JavaScript has global and local scopes. Variables declared outside of a function have global scope, which means they're available everywhere in your code. However, if you define a variable inside a function, it becomes local to that function and cannot be used outside of it. Variables can also be scoped inside if conditions or blocks unless you use the var keyword, which hoists the variable up into the local scope for that function.
Functions are one of the main building blocks in JavaScript. They work by taking an input or argument, then optionally return a value that can be used somewhere else. Functions can be defined using the function keyword or the arrow syntax for function expressions. They can also be nested to create a closure that encapsulates data and logic from the rest of the program.
JavaScript also has objects, which can contain a collection of key-value pairs or properties and values. Objects can inherit properties from each other thanks to a mechanism called the prototype chain. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with the class keyword, which is just syntactic sugar for prototypal inheritance and objects.
JavaScript has several built-in data structures, including arrays, sets, and maps. Arrays are used to hold a dynamic collection of indexed items, while sets hold a collection of unique items. Maps are like objects but can be more easily looped over and contain a key-value pair.
Finally, JavaScript has an interesting feature called the event loop, which allows you to write asynchronous code that runs in a separate thread pool while the rest of the application continues to execute. This is important because modern websites often have multiple things going on at the same time, but they only have access to a single thread for computing called the main thread. Asynchronous code is executed in the background, and its results are later returned to the main thread.
